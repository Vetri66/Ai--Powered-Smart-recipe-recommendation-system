## 🧠 Project Description
The Smart Recipe System is designed to simplify daily cooking and meal planning by combining Artificial Intelligence, data analytics, and algorithmic optimization. Users can generate recipes using available ingredients or browse recipes directly based on preferences such as calories, cuisine, cooking time, and diet type.
The system integrates AI models like OpenAI and Google Gemini to generate recipes, understand dietary requirements, and assist users through natural language interactions. Nutritional APIs provide detailed calorie and macronutrient analysis. A smart meal planner helps users schedule meals for the week, and a shopping list is generated automatically from planned meals.
